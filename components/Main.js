  About Me
</h3>
<p>
 Aspiring junior web developer with excellent communication and people skills, in addition to strong organization and time management.  Currently making a transition from customer service to technology as a junior web developer.  Completed an immersive coding bootcamp, Savvy Coders, where I  learned the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript and how to build a SPA from scratch.  Although I have graduated from Savvy Coders, I am continuing my education by taking a online certified scrum master class. I also have an Agile Certification and I am ready to work in a team friendly environment.

This research is significant because we already know that alx4a is important, but we don't know if it is a pioneering factor. This work investigates a question regarding epigenetic and transcriptional dynamics that regulate cell fate decisions in zebrafish. To study cell fate dynamics of iridophores, I created an alx4a overexpression construct under the control of the mitfa promoter specific to NCC’s.

<h3>
My Research Paper
</h3>

<p>
  Throughout development, the regulation of cell fate decisions are critical to properly differentiate all cell types within the body of an organism. Therefore, studying these regulatory processes is important. One such type of regulatory decision in zebrafish is the specification of pigment cells from Neural Crest Cells (NCC). There have been numerous studies on the specification of two pigment cell types, melanocytes and xanthophores.
</p>
<p>
However, there has been minimal research on the regulation of another pigment cell type, iridophores. Our lab’s previous work showed that the deletion of alx4a, a transcription factor, led to iridophore loss. The basis of this project is to see if an increase in alx4a expression leads to an increase in iridophores. To accomplish this we constructed a pigment progenitor-specific alx4a overexpression plasmid.
</p>
<p>
 To study cell fate decisions we use Dan riero, (zebrafish). Zebrafish are a good model to study because zebrafish reproduce fast, with large numbers of offspring, and have transparent embryogenesis, which makes phenotypes easy to see. There are also many useful genetic tools that can be used in zebrafish studies.
</p>
<p>
  The overarching goal of this project is to study the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of neural crest cell fate. This project follows the belief of Waddington’s landscape (1), which states that all cells start at the top of the mountain (undifferentiated) and as they go down they make epigenetic decisions . The more the cells go down the hill, the more specific the choices become.
</p>
<p>
  During the differentiation process, the neural crest (NC)-derived pigment  progenitor cells differentiate into melanocytes (black), xanthophores (yellow), and iridophores (reflective).
</p>
<p>
  Prior to my research, Ting Wang’s lab studied the effects that alx4a has on cell fate decisions in zebrafish. The study compared melanocyte and iridophore epigenetic dynamics and found the alx4a binding sequence was present in iridophore-specific epigenetic signatures. The researchers discovered that the deletion of alx4a causes a loss in Iridophores in zebrafish. This was a breakthrough in understanding of iridophore cell fate regulation but left unanswered question
</p>
<p>
 One of the questions we asked was, what would be the result of alx4a overexpression. Since the knockout (KO) of alx4a led to a loss of iridophores (Fig 2), we hypothesized that the number of iridophores will increase. In this project, alx4a will be overexpressed in the zebrafish pigment progenitor cells. We hypothesize that alx4a is the key transcription factor in neural crest cell fate decisions in zebrafish.

</p>
<p>
To overexpress alx4a in zebrafish NCC’s we built an overexpression construct including the mitfa promoter (NCC-specific) and the alx4a coding sequence using Gibson Assembly (Fig 5 and 8). We use the mitfa promoter because it is expressed in NCC pigment progenitor cells. I transformed and grew colonies of the mifa-EGFP construct to obtain DNA for downstream use (Fig 4). We amplified out the mitfa promoter region with 40 bp overlapping region of the Swal side of the vector (Fig 6). The alx4a CDS with 40bp overlap region was amplified out for each side of the mitfa promoter and Kpnl side of the vector (Fig 7). For the Gibson Assembly of the alx4a minicoopr EGFP plasmid, we used the 5:1 molar ratio of the fragment and vector to perform the Gibson Assembly. The Gibson reaction was validated by running half of the reaction on a DNA gel (Fig. 8). We transformed the remaining Gibson into a reaction.

</p>
<p>
 In the upcoming fall we expect to carry out further work on this project. We will inject the plasmid into the zebrafish embryos before pigment progenitor cell differentiation. We expect to see a surplus of iridophores. We will also strive to validate other transcription factors
