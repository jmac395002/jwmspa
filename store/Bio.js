    " Aspiring junior web developer with excellent communication and people skills, in addition to strong organization and time management.  Currently making a transition from customer service to technology as a junior web developer.  Completed an immersive coding bootcamp, Savvy Coders, where I  learned the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript and how to build a SPA from scratch.  Although I have graduated from Savvy Coders, I am continuing my education by taking a online certified scrum master class. I also have an Agile Certification and I am ready to work in a team friendly environment."
