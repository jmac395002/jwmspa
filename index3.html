  About Me
</h3>
<p>
 Aspiring junior web developer with excellent communication and people skills, in addition to strong organization and time management.  Currently making a transition from customer service to technology as a junior web developer.  Completed an immersive coding bootcamp, Savvy Coders, where I  learned the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript and how to build a SPA from scratch.  Although I have graduated from Savvy Coders, I am continuing my education by taking a online certified scrum master class. I also have an Agile Certification and I am ready to work in a team friendly environment.

<p>
Completing the Savvy Coders immersive coding bootcamp, learning JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, JSON, UI/UX, Project Planning through Trello and Kanban, and Agile. I am in the process of learning scrum and I will be learning C++ in the fall during my studies at Fontbonne University.

<h3>
 Internship with Washington University
</h3>

<p>
At Washington University I designed, maintained and organized wet laboratory activities. These include: ordering supplies, reagent preparation, overseeing health and safety compliance, and keeping lab running efficiently. I individually directed one project and assisted with many others.

This research is significant because we already know that alx4a is important, but we don't know if it is a pioneering factor. This work investigates a question regarding epigenetic and transcriptional dynamics that regulate cell fate decisions in zebrafish. To study cell fate dynamics of iridophores, I created an alx4a overexpression construct under the control of the mitfa promoter specific to NCC’s.

<h3>
My Research Paper
</h3>

<p>
  Throughout development, the regulation of cell fate decisions are critical to properly differentiate all cell types within the body of an organism. Therefore, studying these regulatory processes is important. One such type of regulatory decision in zebrafish is the specification of pigment cells from Neural Crest Cells (NCC). There have been numerous studies on the specification of two pigment cell types, melanocytes and xanthophores.
</p>
<p>
However, there has been minimal research on the regulation of another pigment cell type, iridophores. Our lab’s previous work showed that the deletion of alx4a, a transcription factor, led to iridophore loss. The basis of this project is to see if an increase in alx4a expression leads to an increase in iridophores. To accomplish this we constructed a pigment progenitor-specific alx4a overexpression plasmid.
</p>
<p>
 To study cell fate decisions we use Dan riero, (zebrafish). Zebrafish are a good model to study because zebrafish reproduce fast, with large numbers of offspring, and have transparent embryogenesis, which makes phenotypes easy to see. There are also many useful genetic tools that can be used in zebrafish studies.
</p>
<p>
  The overarching goal of this project is to study the epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of neural crest cell fate. This project follows the belief of Waddington’s landscape (1), which states that all cells start at the top of the mountain (undifferentiated) and as they go down they make epigenetic decisions . The more the cells go down the hill, the more specific the choices become.
</p>
<p>
  During the differentiation process, the neural crest (NC)-derived pigment  progenitor cells differentiate into melanocytes (black), xanthophores (yellow), and iridophores (reflective).
